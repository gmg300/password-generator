# Password Generator v0.2

## Description
A password generator using a simple UI and javascript to generate passwords.

Users can customize the password length as well as what types of characters are included in the password. Settings are validated and the result is written to the page. User settings are created with a number input and checkboxes and invalid inputs return an error message to the user. 

The biggest challenge for me was correctly validating the user settings and returning error messages to the user.

In future implementations I'd like to refactor the code for efficiency, and add a button to toggle password visibility and a button to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.
