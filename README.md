![Password Generator Gif](assets/images/password-generator.gif)

## Description
A password generator using a simple Bootstrap UI and javascript.

Users can customize the password length as well as what types of characters are included in the password. Settings are validated and the result is written to the page. User settings are created with a number input and checkboxes and invalid inputs return an error message to the user. 

**v0.3.0**
* Fixed - Code has been refactored so that every type of character is used when checked by the user no matter the length of the password
* Improved - Reorganized error messaging as it's own function

**Future Versions**
* Create a ranged slider bar to sit along side the number input box
* Refactor the character generation so that the order of random characters in each loop through is also randomized
* Un-spaghettify the generatePassword function
