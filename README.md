# Password Generator v0.1

## Description
A password generator using a simple UI and javascript to generate passwords.

Users can customize the password length as well as what types of characters are included in the password. Settings are validated and the result is written to the page. User settings are created with prompt and confirmation pop ups within the window, the check boxes and number selector on the page are not currently functional. 

In future implementations I would like to eliminate prompt, confirms and alerts and use the checkboxes and a ranged number slider for user settings. I'd also like to add a button to toggle password visibility once generated and a button to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.
